                smaller companies - you pay as 
                you go - meaning, if you go for 
                weeks without a customer, you 
                don't have to pay a dime.</strong><br><br>
    
                - Single user model only allows one user to be
                using the system at a time. <br> <br>
                - Report are generated using prepaid credits
                similar to recharging a prepaid phone card.<br><br>
                - You have the option to switch over to Enterprise mode at any time.

           		You have selected the Single User payment plan. <br><br>
                Single users are only allowed one user to be using the system at a time. 
                Payment works much like a prepaid phone plan, where  the system is 
                "recharged" for credits to be used on reports and other functions.<br><br>
    
                You can recharge credits as you go at your own pace once your account 
                is set up. You may also upgrade to Enterprise User once your business 
                grows to the point where flat-rate subscription becomes more economical.<br><br>
                Clicking "Next" will prompt you will the credit purchase screen. Select how many credits you would like
                to purchase to get started.
